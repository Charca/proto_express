## Express Stack

Nothing useful here, just a stack for Express Apps.

Uses the Yo generator-node-express: https://github.com/lukelarsen/generator-node-express
And the Heroku Buildpack: https://github.com/stephanmelzer/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt-compass to run grunt and sass on Heroku

It includes several modifications from the original generator, and it works out of the box with Heroku
